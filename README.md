# README:

This repo is mostly just a port of [https://github.com/avinassh/go-caskdb](go-caskdb)

- Used mainly as a learning project.
- Did not necessarily go through the steps prescribed.
- Read the paper , got a basic understanding. Started writing code and wherever I felt stuck
  went through the go implementation.
